<p>This is an example post. Write your blogposts in HTML like a real man and control your <strong>own</strong> <span style="text-decoration:strike-through">goddamn</span> formatting. Since this is just a bunch of python cgi to glue some html files together have fun with it.</p>

<p>Please, as a favour to me, don't leave this post in tact. And make sure to remove the reference to it in the file which stores all the information about the posts. It'd be silly to have this show up as your very very first post because it wasn't authored by you at all. It was authored by me.</p>
